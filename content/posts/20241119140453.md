**Note**: 

- This article assumes that the reader is trying to build and run a kernel with *qemu*, on linux, in order to develop kernel modules.
- The author is **not an experienced kernel developer**. These are just notes to document their learning, and to keep for future reference.
- If you are only interested in setting up a minimal environment, feel free to the *Building the kernel* section. 


## Background Knowledge

Setting up a development environment in which the developer is able to freely and safely ~~abuse the kernel~~ load and unload kernel modules is the first step in kernel hacking. There are other approaches to setting up an environment, such as installing the kernel on actual hardware and using a debug interface, or setting up a virtual machine, etc. In this article we explore how to run a locally built linux kernel using `qemu`.

In order to achieve this, there are two main components we must be concerned with:

- The linux kenrel
- The initramfs (`busybox` + config files + α)

Before diving into building the environment, I would like to dedicate a few paragraphs to exploring the aforementioned components. If you are not interested, please feel free to skip forward to the relevant section.

If we take a look at the contents of `/boot`, you will see something like the following (the names and content will differ depending on the distro and architecture):

```console
$ cd /boot/
$ ls
amd-ucode.img  EFI  grub  initramfs-linux-fallback.img  initramfs-linux.img  vmlinuz-linux
$ file vmlinuz-linux
vmlinuz-linux: Linux kernel x86 boot executable bzImage, version 6.11.8-artix1-2 (linux@artixlinux) #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Fri, 15 Nov 2024 18:25:29 +0000, RO-rootFS, swap_dev 0XC, Normal VGA
$ file initramfs-linux.img
initramfs-linux.img: ASCII cpio archive (SVR4 with no CRC)
```

What we are concerned with is `vmlinuz-linux` and `initramfs-linux.img` (again, the name will probably differ depending on your environment). These are the compressed linux kernel and the initramfs. A compressed kernel? I initially assumed this was due to historic reasons, when disk space was quite constrained (still constrained in embedded systems, but I'm not sure if they use kernel compression). However, there seems to be additional reasons besides that  [^1]. During the boot procedure, the kernel is decompressed into memory by the bootloader. The bootloader then hands control over to the loaded kernel.

We can try running this kernel with `qemu`, just to see what happens. 
```console

```

Wonderful.

As the console log suggests, the kernel panicked because it was not able to find a root fs to mount. That is, the file system that is mounted on `/`. This is quite natural since we didn't specify a disk to `qemu`. `qemu` had loaded and ran the kernel, the kernel did some initialization, and attempted to mount the root fs, but didn't find anything and crashed. This is where the initramfs enters the scene.

```console
$ reset     # run reset if the output has become corrupted
$ qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel /boot/vmlinuz-linux -initrd /boot/initramfs-linux.img -m 512 -enable-kvm -append "console=ttyS0" -nographic

```
So, who is this initramfs person, and what role do they play in the boot process? 

The initramfs is a compressed file system (a `cpio` file that is gzipped), containing various tools, kernel modules, configuration files, and other files required to complete the boot procedure. As its name suggests, the initramfs is a ram based file system [^2]. That is, the contents of the initramfs is extracted out into memory at boot-time, and is mounted on `/` as a temporary file system. Later on, the actual root file system will be mounted over it.

This naturally causes one to beg the question why the initramfs is necessary. At first glance, it seems to make sense just to mount the root file system directly instead of having an intermediary. Indeed, apparently there are setups which do not require an initramfs. The short and admittedly vague answer is that there are some operations that must be performed in order to mount the root file system in the first place (the root file system cannot be accessed at this point in the boot process). 

An example of this is would be full disk encryption. Assuming the setup was done with LVM on LUKS [^3], we may have something like the following:

```console
# Taken from the arch wiki
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+ +----------------+
| Logical volume 1      | Logical volume 2      | Logical volume 3      | | Boot partition |
|                       |                       |                       | |                |
| [SWAP]                | /                     | /home                 | | /boot          |
|                       |                       |                       | |                |
| /dev/MyVolGroup/swap  | /dev/MyVolGroup/root  | /dev/MyVolGroup/home  | |                |
|_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _| | (may be on     |
|                                                                       | | other device)  |
|                         LUKS encrypted partition                      | |                |
|                           /dev/sda1                                   | | /dev/sdb1      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+ +----------------+
```

In this scenario, `/dev/sda1` must be decrypted, and the logical volumes must be reconstructed. After this is done, Logical volume 2 is mounted on `/`, Logical volume 3 on `/home`, and so on and so forth...except the related tools and configuration files live in `/`, which lives in a logical volume, in the encrypted partition... Even to make things worse, the kernel code to handle the various file systems are usually a kernel module -- for instance, on my laptop which uses ext4, it is dependent on `ext4.ko` -- which also lives on the root file system. 

The initramfs packages all of these into a compressed file system. One of the files it contains -- or rather, must contain -- is `init`, which kicks off this stage of the boot process. After decompressing the initramfs, the kernel executes `init`, which is responsible for performing the various steps to enable the root partition to be mounted. 

At this point you may be wondering if this is really necessary for booting the kernel with `qemu`. While we are certainly not doing anything complicated with our disk setup -- in fact, we don't even have one -- it's simply part of the boot process. As demonstrated earlier, if an initramfs is not given to `qemu`, the kernel will panic.

From this point onward, we will be building the development environment. Specifically, we will:

1. Obtain the source and build the linux kernel.
1. Create an initramfs based on `busybox`.

## Building the Kernel
The kernel can be obtained either from <https://www.kernel.org/> or <https://github.com/torvalds/linux>. The version of the kernel to obtain depends on the programmer's needs. If their project requires a specific version of the kernel, they will simply choose that. For the purpose of this article, I will be using version *6.11.8*. 

```console
$ curl --tlsv1.2 --proto https -L https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/linux-6.11.8.tar.xz | tar xvJ
```

Before building the kernel a configuration has to be generated. This can be done through running `make menuconfig`, which will present the user with a `ncurses` based menu to configure the build process (note, `ncurses` may not be installed by default). However, there are also a few default configurations we can choose from. These configurations have the format of `<target-hardware>_defconfig`.

```console
$ find -name "*_defconfig"
./arch/arm/configs/mvebu_v5_defconfig
./arch/arm/configs/aspeed_g4_defconfig
./arch/arm/configs/sama5_defconfig
./arch/arm/configs/mmp2_defconfig
./arch/arm/configs/multi_v5_defconfig
./arch/arm/configs/versatile_defconfig
./arch/arm/configs/nhk8815_defconfig
./arch/arm/configs/omap2plus_defconfig
./arch/arm/configs/clps711x_defconfig
./arch/arm/configs/davinci_all_defconfig
....
./arch/x86/configs/i386_defconfig
./arch/x86/configs/x86_64_defconfig
./arch/um/configs/i386_defconfig
./arch/um/configs/x86_64_defconfig
```
We will be using the x86_64_defconfig, and building the kernel.
```console
$ make x86_64_defconfig
  HOSTCC  scripts/kconfig/conf.o
  HOSTLD  scripts/kconfig/conf
#
# configuration written to .config
#
$ make -j $(nproc)
```

More than likely, there will be some tools required for the build process that will not be present. If the bulid process fails due to the lack of a tool, simply install it and restart the build process.

```console
  CHKSHA1 include/linux/atomic/atomic-arch-fallback.h
/bin/sh: line 1: bc: command not found                      <---- 
  CHKSHA1 include/linux/atomic/atomic-instrumented.h

  LINK    /home/vilroi/linux-6.11.8/tools/objtool/objtool
make: *** [Makefile:224: __sub-make] Error 2
```

If everything goes well, you should have a new `vmlinux` in the project root, and a compressed kernel named `arch/x86/boot/bzImage`.

```console
  AS      arch/x86/boot/compressed/piggy.o
  LD      arch/x86/boot/compressed/vmlinux
  OBJCOPY arch/x86/boot/vmlinux.bin
  ZOFFSET arch/x86/boot/zoffset.h
  AS      arch/x86/boot/header.o
  LD      arch/x86/boot/setup.elf
  OBJCOPY arch/x86/boot/setup.bin
  BUILD   arch/x86/boot/bzImage
Kernel: arch/x86/boot/bzImage is ready  (#1)
```
## Building busybox

Similar to the kernel, the version of busybox to use is case dependent. The author will be using version *1.37.0*, as that is the latest version at the time of writing.

```console
$ curl --tlsv1.2 --proto https -L https://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.37.0.tar.bz2 | tar xvj 
```

We will be taking the default configuration, and will be creating a statically linked binary.  

```console
$ make defconfig
$ make menuconfig
  Settings  ---> 
    --- Build Options                                         
    [*] Build static binary (no shared libs)

$ make -j $(nproc)
```

If everything goes well, there should be a copy of busybox in the project root directory.

```console
$ ls 
applets                      configs        INSTALL          make_single_applets.sh  scripts
applets_sh                   console-tools  klibc-utils      miscutils               selinux

Config.in                    init           Makefile.help    runit

$ file busybox

```

At the time of writing, there are two known issues that hinders the build process. The reader may also encounter these issues, so I will list the workarounds below.

The first error occurs when trying to run `make menuconfig`. One of the scripts which checks for the availability for `ncurses` will claim that it isn't installed, even after installing it.

```console
$ make menuconfig 

...

  HOSTCC  scripts/kconfig/lxdialog/yesno.o
  HOSTLD  scripts/kconfig/lxdialog/lxdialog
 *** Unable to find the ncurses libraries or the
 *** required header files.
 *** 'make menuconfig' requires the ncurses libraries.
 ***

make[1]: *** [/home/vilroi/src/busybox-1.37.0/scripts/kconfig/Makefile:14: menuconfig] Error 2
make: *** [Makefile:444: menuconfig] Error 2
```

The script in question seems to check for `ncurses` by compiling a simple c program which links to it [^4]. A fixed version of this can be found here [^5]. 

The other issue is with compiling `tc`.

```console
networking/tc.c: In function ‘cbq_print_opt’:
networking/tc.c:236:27: error: ‘TCA_CBQ_MAX’ undeclared (first use in this function); did you mean ‘TCA_CBS_MAX’?

      |                           ^~~~~~~~~~~

networking/tc.c:261:16: error: ‘TCA_CBQ_WRROPT’ undeclared (first use in this function)
```

This seems to be a known issue, and one of the members in the mailing list suggests either disabling the build of `tc`, or using newer headers [^6]. I will be opting for the former solution. 

```console
 --- Applets
    Networking Utilities  --->
      [ ] tc (8.3 kb)   <-- Toggle off

```

For those who haven't worked with `busybox` before, `busybox` has the interesting property of acting as a different command based on its name. For instance, we could make a copy of the built `busybox` binary named `ls` and `date`, and then try to run it.

```console
$ cp busybox ls
$ cp busybox date
$ ./ls

## Building an initramfs

First things first, we run `make install` in the `busybox` project root directory. This creates a new directory `_install` which contains a simple file system.

```console
$ make install
$ mkdir _install/{dev,proc,sys}
$ ls _install/
bin  dev  linuxrc  proc  sbin  sys  usr
```

Behind the scenes, `make install` runs an install script which amongst other things creates a symbolic link to the `busybox` binary built earlier, with the name of the various utilities.

```console
$ cd _install
$ ls bin/
arch     chown     dnsdomainname  fsync     ipcalc    lsattr      mpstat         printenv   run-parts     stty    vi

There is one crucial program that is missing: `init`. After the kernel decompresses the `initramfs`, the kernel finds `init` and runs it. If there is no `init`, the boot process will fail.

Technically speaking, `init` can be any program as long as it's named `init`. It could be a shell script, or it could also be a compiled binary. I assume it could even be written in python or javascript, but it will probably require the user to package the language runtime as well as its dependencies. To keep things simple, I believe either a shell script or a statically compiled binary would be preferred. Before presenting the actual `init` script that will be used, I will write a fake one just to get the point across.

```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Printf("Happy Kernel Hacking ❣🐧\n")
	time.Sleep(1000000 * time.Second)
}
```

I will package the program above into an `initramfs`...

```console
$ go build
$ cp init ../busybox-vilroi/_install/ && cd ../busybox-vilroi/_install/
$ find . -print0 | cpio --null -ov --format=newc | gzip -9 > ../../initramfs.cpio.gz
.                                                                    15:17:57 [393/413]
./proc
./linuxrc
./usr
./usr/sbin
./usr/sbin/setfont
./usr/sbin/i2cget
./usr/sbin/nbd-client
...
```

... and run it.

```console
$ qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel linux-6.11.8/arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage -initrd ./initramfs.cpio.gz --enable-kvm --append "console=ttyS0" -nographic -m 512

```

The actual `init` script is the following, a modified version of the one written by KernW0lf [^7]: 
```bash
#!/bin/sh

mount -t devtmpfs none /dev
mount -t proc none /proc
mount -t sysfs none /sys

exec /bin/sh
```

Place the above along side the other files in `_install`. If there are other files you would like to package, such as kernel moduels, you will place it in here as well.

In order to build the `initramfs`, we run the following in `_install/`.

```console
$ find . -print0 | cpio --null -ov --format=newc | gzip -9 > ../../initramfs.cpio.gz
```

## Running the Kernel

At this point, we have all of the components required to run the kernel. Pass the path to the kernel and `initramfs` with the `-kernel` and `-initrd` options respectively.

```console
qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel linux-6.11.8/arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage -initrd ./initramfs.cpio.gz --enable-kvm --append "console=ttyS0" -nographic -m 512
