## Overview
A serial console is a connection to a computer over a serial line (that is, it transmits data one bit at a time). It allows a user to access to interact with a computer which lacks a display and keyboard (headless machine, embedded device, networking equipment, etc).

In order to interact with a device through a serial console, a RS232 cable is required.

## Configuring the Serial Console
The following configuration has been implemented on debian 12.8.

First, we identify the 
```console
$ sudo dmesg | grep tty
[    0.070799] printk: console [tty0] enabled
[    0.442231] 00:06: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4, base_baud = 115200) is a 16550A
[    0.442975] 0000:00:16.3: ttyS1 at I/O 0xf0e0 (irq = 19, base_baud = 115200) is a 16550A
[   73.033292] systemd[1]: Created slice system-getty.slice - Slice /system/getty.
```
