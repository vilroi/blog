In the olden days, terminal were actual physical devices. It was an I/O device which was able to send and receive text data to and from a computer it was connected to. The terminal device and computer were connected either through a hardwired cable or over the network via a modem.

Depending on the model of the computer (main frame, etc) it seemed like it was possible to hook up multiple terminals simultaneously, thus allowing multiple users in different parts of the building (or in a different geographical location) to interact with the system. Perhaps this is at least one of the reasons the need for time-sharing operating systems arose.
