Hi, I go by vilroi online.

This blog is intended to be a public repository of my notes, on-going projects, and more.

In case you're curious, the domain is taken from the [sigaltstack(2)](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sigaltstack.2.html) syscall in \*nix like operating systems.

All views and opinions expressed on this blog are mine, and do not represent those of others.

Also, I have no affiliation with any of the product links I post on this blog.
